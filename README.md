## Transmon Simulations with DRAG

<ol type="a">
 <li>TSimulate the dynamics of a two level system, i.e. a qubit, both in the lab frame and
in the qubit frame.</li>
 <li>Simulation of a transmon qubit with 3 levels and small anharmonicity.</li>
 <li>Apply the GRAPE algorithm to find optimal control solutions.</li>
