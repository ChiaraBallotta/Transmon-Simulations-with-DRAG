## Transmon Simulations with DRAG
  (a) Simulate the dynamics of a two level system, i.e. a qubit, both in the lab frame and
in the qubit frame.
  (b) Simulation of a transmon qubit with 3 levels and small anharmonicity.
  (c) Implement a Gaussian-drag pulse to reduce the effect of leakage.
  (d) Apply the GRAPE algorithm to find optimal control solutions.
